# VR-Experience
Unity Project for VR includes hospital room/assets and VR tutorial assets 

The project still needs to be set up for an actual VR headset as it was only tested without one.

Some functions are still missing from the hospital section:
- Teleport pads/locations
- More pickable objects
- Events with the objects
- Sockets for objects
- Connect rooms
- Working doors
